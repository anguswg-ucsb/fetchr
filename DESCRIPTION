Description: Provides functions for fast and scalable fetch distance calculations for landwater raster data. Polygon based approaches for calculating multipoint and multidirection distance-to-land values are avaliable and work on a small scale with a small number of points. A raster based approach allows for a much greater number of points to be processed in a fraction of the time and without crashing ones computer.
