Title: fetchr: Calculate Fetch Distances for Geospatial Data

Description: Provides functions for fast and scalable fetch distance calculations for landwater raster or vector data. 
    Polygon based approaches for calculating multipoint and multidirection distance-to-land values are avaliable and work on a small scale with a small number of points. 
    A raster based approach allows for a much greater number of points to be processed in a fraction of the time that other vector based approaches take.
