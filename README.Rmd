<hr>

The goal of `fetchr` is to provide a fast and efficient raster based method for calculating fetch lengths across thousands of water grid cells. 
Calculating fetch lengths, the distance that wind can blow in a constant direction over a body of water without interruption, can be a slow and memory intensive process when done on thousands of points of interest in multiple directions. `fetchr` attempts to fix this problem and allows for thousands of fetch calculations to be performed in a fraction of the time that other methods take.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `fetchr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/anguswg-ucsb/fetchr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anguswg-ucsb/fetchr")
```

## Coastline raster

If we start with a raster representing the Southern California coast near Santa Barbara, CA.

```{r example}
library(fetchr)

# land raster
land_rast <- terra::rast(fetchr::land)

terra::plot(land_rast, col = "#2e8b57")
```

<br>

## Make a binary land water rasters
We can take this land raster, indicate which cells are water cells, and create a binary land water raster (land = 0, water = 1).
```{r binary_lw}
# binary land water raster 
landwater <- fetchr::get_landwater(
  r           = land_rast,                 # land raster
  water_value = NA,                        # cells with a value of NA are classified as water, all other cells are land
  res         = terra::res(land_rast)[1]   # return raster with the same cell resolution as input raster
  )

terra::plot(landwater, col = c("#2e8b57", "#add8e6"))
```

This raster now meets all the specification for using `get_fetch()`:

  - Binary cell values (land cells = 0 and water cells = 1)
  - Projected Coordinate Reference System
  - Regular grid cell size (same x and y cell resolution)

<br>

## Calculate fetch length

Now let's calculate our fetch length raster
```{r fetch_calc}
system.time(
  
  fetch <- fetchr::get_fetch(
    r        = landwater,     # binary land water raster
    max_dist = 200000,        # maximum distance to calculate fetch in meters (200km)
    ncores   = 12,            # number of computer cores to use 
    verbose  = TRUE
    )
  
)

plot(fetch)
```

In this example here, calculating fetch distances for > 24,000 water cells took about ~20 seconds, or ~0.00083 seconds per point. That is a  ~ 99.92% reduction in computation time compared to various other polygon based methods out there!
